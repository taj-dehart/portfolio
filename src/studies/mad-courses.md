[MAD Courses](https://madcourses.com) is a social enterprise whose goal is to educate
people around the world about systems thinking, indigenous wisdom and environmental
stewardship. They work with tribes in the Philippines to create interactive &ldquo;video
adventures,&rdquo; their own brand of gamified educational videos.

## My Role

MAD is a small startup, so their team grows and changes regularly, with new contractors
coming in and team members shifting roles fluidly.

MAD needed a variety of design work to help tie together the look and feel of their
products, including a website and a brand guide.

MAD&rsquo;s video courses are packaged with worksheets, digital minigames and activities
deliver presentations around the globe. The brand needed to be distinct, to stand out
from other ed-tech businesses, while being versatile enough to work with MAD&rsquo;s
different products.

## Brand Guide

They needed a brand guide to give cohesion to their website, print products,
presentations and some of MAD&rsquo;s more unique digital tools.

MAD teaches students to use _systems thinkings frameworks,_ like this worksheet

Because MAD is such a dynamic company, I knew the style guide would be used by many
people for many different tasks. I decided that the style guide should lend itself to
symbolic, reuseable elements.

I came up with the idea of emulating the ink designs of a passport stamp or a
screen-printed t-shirt. This effect evoked travel to me, and the excitement and
imagination of DIY projects. It was also very simple &mdash; once I had the process
down, I was able to create an entire library of inky designs that were attractive but
versatile.

Some of MAD's projects would require more visual intrigue. My second idea was also
_skeumorphic,_ a term that broadly means 2D design that emulates real 3D objects. This
time I took that definition to it&rsquo;s extreme, creating illustrations which mimic
actual maps, boarding passes, stamps and notebook pages. I wanted to lend a tactile,
realistic feel to the tools MAD was creating, to help them stand out from other
education technology.

> Illustrations in the grainy style:

When combined, these two styles create a very distinctive, adaptable, beautiful design
language. I described this style alongside some guidelines for using it most effectively
in the style guide.

## Website

The style guide also gave me direction as I tackled MAD's website redesign. I wanted to
combine the two styles discussed above, but I knew this would be challenging as the
inky, sketchy style I'd crafted matched poorly with the rigidity of most website
builders.

After a lot of trial and error, I discovered that
[SVG filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_Filters_Tutorial)
were the solution. Using these, I developed some stylish vector graphics to explain the
MAD product.

These had all the flair of the MAD raster illustrations but remained highly performant.
I had managed to unify the design for MAD's brochure website, their marketing and their
main product. âœ¦
